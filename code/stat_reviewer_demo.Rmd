Let $X$ ~ $N(1, 1)$ and let $Y$ ~ $N(0, 1)$ with $Cov(X,Y) = 9/10$.


```{r}

library(MASS)

covmat <- matrix(data = c(1, 9/10, 9/10, 1), nrow = 2)

data <- mvrnorm(n = 10000000, Sigma = covmat, mu = c(1, 0))

x <- data[,1]
y <- data[,2]

```

An approximate 95% confidence interval for $X$ is (-0.96, 2.96)

```{r}

quantile(x, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))

```

and a 95% confidence interval for $Y$ is approximately (-1.96, 1.96)

```{r}

quantile(y, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))

```

Notably, these confidence limits overlap. However, elementary probability tells us that $$Var(X-Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) - 2 \times Cov(X,Y) = 20/10 - 18/10 = 1/5$$. Thus, a 95% confidence limit for $X-Y$ is approximately (0.12, 1.88)

```{r}

quantile(x-y, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))

```
